Galleries keep information about artists, their names (which are unique), birthplaces, age
and style of art. For each piece of artwork, the artist, the year it was made, its unique title, its
type of art (e.g., painting, lithograph, sculpture, photograph), and its price must be stored.

Pieces of artwork are also classified into groups of various kinds, for example, portraits, still
lifes, works by Picasso, or works of the 19th century; a given piece may belong to more than
one group.

Each group is identified by a name (like those just given) that describes the group. Finally,
galleries keep information about customers.

For each customer, galleries keep that personâ€™s unique name, address, total amount of
dollars spent in the gallery (very important!), and the artists and groups of art that the
customer tends to like.
